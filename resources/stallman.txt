If you want to accomplish something in the world, idealism is not

Facebook is not your friend, it is a surveillance engine.

Android is very different from the GNU/Linux operating system because
it contains very little of GNU. Indeed, just about the only component
in common between Android and GNU/Linux is Linux, the kernel.

Also, because schools must teach the spirit of goodwill, the habit of
helping others around you, every class should have this rule:
students, if you bring software to class you may not keep it for
yourself.

Free software is software that respects your freedom and the social
solidarity of your community. So it's free as in freedom.

It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of
brains must be in want of more brains.

My friend says the irony of being a zombie is that everything is
funny, but you can't smile, because your lips have rotted off.
